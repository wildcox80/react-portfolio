## Description
This is my personal resume website built with ReactJS. I am using my own React resume website template that can be found <a href="https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template">HERE.</a>

## I'm looking for work
I am currently travelling Southeast Asia following my University studies but I will be actively looking for work when my trip is over. My location preference is Victoria, BC as my girlfriend will return to school there after our travels but I am open to remote work and can potentially make other arrangements if the right job comes along.
